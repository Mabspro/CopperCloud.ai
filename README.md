# CopperCloud Website

## Project Overview

**CopperCloud.ai** - Zambia's independent standards authority and policy engine for digital sovereignty. A sophisticated landing page positioning CopperCloud as a neutral, authoritative body that sets the rules for sovereign digital infrastructure but never plays in it—think "Zambia's NIST meets Switzerland."

### Mission Statement
Architect Zambia's digital independence through open standards, policy frameworks, and sovereign infrastructure doctrine. Starting with Zambia's renewable energy advantage, CopperCloud builds the intelligent grid that unlocks telecom, cloud, and AI—keeping data and value in African hands.

### Core Identity
**What CopperCloud IS:**
- Independent Policy Arm: Research-driven think tank producing frameworks, standards, and governance models
- Standards Authority: Administrator of "Sovereign-Ready" certification program (Bronze/Silver/Gold tiers)
- National Orchestrator: Champion of "Open-Ported Value Stack" doctrine ensuring interoperability
- Government Working Group Secretariat: Cross-ministry coordination facilitator
- Research Engine: Producer of McKinsey-caliber analysis and technical briefs

**What CopperCloud IS NOT:**
- ❌ NOT a systems integrator or infrastructure operator
- ❌ NOT a data center operator or cloud provider
- ❌ NOT an equity investor or vendor
- ❌ NOT captured by government (maintains <40% government funding)

## Strategic Purpose

### Primary Objectives
- **Policy Authority**: Establish credibility as Zambia's independent digital sovereignty standards body
- **Government Relations**: Support ZDA and cross-ministry coordination on Enhanced Energy doctrine
- **Research Credibility**: Showcase McKinsey-caliber analysis proving urgency and opportunity
- **Standards Leadership**: Position as authoritative voice on African digital infrastructure policy

### Target Audiences
1. **Government Officials** - ZDA, Ministry of Technology, Ministry of Energy, policy makers
2. **Development Finance Institutions** - AfDB, World Bank, donor organizations
3. **Standards Bodies & Think Tanks** - International standards organizations, policy researchers
4. **Media & Analysts** - Tech journalists, industry researchers, policy experts

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack
```
Frontend: Pure HTML5/CSS3/Vanilla JS
Styling: Custom CSS with advanced animations and glassmorphism
Typography: Inter (sans-serif) + Charter (serif for headings)
Icons: SVG icons + Unicode/Emoji
Maps: Leaflet.js for interactive Zambia map visualization
Fonts: Google Fonts (Inter, Charter)
